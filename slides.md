# Session Agenda

<v-clicks>

- You'll learn what Github Codespaces are and why you should think about using them
- We'll take a look at how you can customize your projects for everyone, dev environments as code
- And of course how you can get all your nifty personal configurations on top of it all

</v-clicks>

# Codespaces!

### "Your instant dev environment"

The marketing team inside my head would explain codespaces as...

<v-clicks>

- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code on your browser
- Available from any location, from any device
- Customizable for almost any need
- With your own tools
- ... and great GitHub integration

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

DISCLAIMER: I'm not very good at marketing

# Setting up your first codespace

---
---

# So what's my angle?

## I believe codespaces will become a common tool for teams for

<v-clicks>

- Setting up environments as config, allowing everyone to have a similar development setup
  - Pretty much like containers do, without you actually having to containerize your application
  - Bugfixes to older projects no longer require (as much) arcane knowledge

- Arranging trainings

- Sharing cool VS code modules, of course

</v-clicks>

---
---

# Configuration

<v-clicks>

- Config isn't just a feature of codespaces, it's built in to VS code too
  - The base is the `.devcontainer` folder in the root of your repo

- You can use a default container, select from ready made ones, or just customize your own from scratch

- There are decent community made lists of devcontainers too, like [this set](https://github.com/benc-uk/devcontainers) by [Ben Coleman](https://github.com/benc-uk)

# Let's create a configuration for our project

# But what about my cool toys?

<v-clicks>

### Don't worry, you can have those too

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Enter dotfiles and VS code settings sync

- Whenever a file with a certain name, in my case "Setup.sh" is found in the dotfiles repository, it will be fun before `devcontainer` customizations

- If no setup file is found, files and directories starting with . will get symlinked to your home folder in codespaces

- You might want to consider using some tooling for this, but I've just written some spaghetti code

# Code

Use code snippets and get the highlighting directly!

```ts {all|2|1-6|9|all}
interface User {
  id: number
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  role: string
}

function updateUser(id: number, update: Partial<User>) {
  const user = getUser(id)
  const newUser = {...user, ...update}  
  saveUser(id, newUser)
}
```

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly use. And add your custom components are also super easy.

```md
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/custom/#components) for more.

<div>

```html
<Tweet id="1385774635015307265" />
```

<Tweet id="1385774635015307265" scale="0.65" />

# LaTeX

LaTeX is supported out-of-box powered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

<br>

Inline $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

Block
$$
\begin{array}{c}

\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &
= \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}    \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\

\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\

\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0

\end{array}

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes are able to provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://sli.dev/themes/default.png">

<img border="rounded" src="https://sli.dev/themes/seriph.png">

</div>
