# Session Agenda

<v-clicks>

- You'll learn what Github Codespaces are and why you should think about using them
- We'll take a look at how you can customize your projects for everyone, dev environments as code
- And of course how you can get all your nifty personal configurations on top of it all

</v-clicks>

# Codespaces!

### "Your instant dev environment" (BETA)

The marketing team inside my head would explain codespaces as...

<v-clicks>

- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code on your browser
- Available from any location, from any device
- Customizable for almost any need
- With your own tools
- ... and great GitHub integration

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

DISCLAIMER: I'm not very good at marketing

# Setting up your first codespace

---
---
# Some details

<v-clicks>

- üë©‚Äçüíª Can connect from your local VS Code instance too
- üí∏ Free during the beta, [will be billed by use later](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-09-15-about-codespaces-pricing/)
- üíª Multiple VM sizes available even during the beta, though specifics are still unclear
- üêõ Still in beta, so some of the bugs we might spot are most likely still being polished out
- üöÄ GA in Q3-2021 according to [the GitHub public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/55)
- <logos-visual-studio style="display:inline"/> Works with full Visual Studio too!

# So what's my angle?

## I believe codespaces will become a common tool for teams for

<v-clicks>

- Setting up environments as code, allowing everyone to have a similar development setup
  - Pretty much like containers do, without you actually having to containerize your application
  - Bugfixes to older projects no longer require (as much) arcane knowledge

- Arranging trainings

- Sharing cool VS code modules, of course

</v-clicks>

# Configuration

<v-clicks>

- Config isn't just a feature of codespaces, it's built in to VS code
  - The base is the `.devcontainer` folder in the root of your repo
  - You can actually use these for local development inside a container just as well, and reap a subset of the benefits

- You can use a default container, select from ready made ones, or just customize your own from scratch

- There are decent community made lists of devcontainers too, like [this set](https://github.com/benc-uk/devcontainers) by [Ben Coleman](https://github.com/benc-uk)

# Let's create a configuration for our project

# But what about my cool toys?

<v-clicks>

### Don't worry, you can have those too

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Enter dotfiles and VS code settings sync

- `yourGitHubUser/dotfiles` repository will get synced to every codespace you create

- Whenever a file with a certain name, in my case "Setup.sh" is found in the dotfiles repository, it will be fun after(?) `devcontainer` customizations
  - Documentation does say "before" but this doesn't seem to be the case

- If no setup file is found, files and directories starting with . will get symlinked to your home folder in codespaces

- You might want to consider using some tooling for this, but I've just written some spaghetti code

</v-clicks>

# Settings Sync

<v-clicks>

- Built in to VS Code (so NOT the extension in the marketplace)

- Allows you to log in to your GitHub or Microsoft account to sync all settings from keybindings to extensions and themes

- Sync is almost instant from one device to another

- Can ignore certain settings easily
